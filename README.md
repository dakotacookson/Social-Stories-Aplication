# Social-Stories-Aplication

PIP is a single page application inspired by my mother, 
an educator who works with autistic youth. The app was designed to help bolster 
the social ability of students with high functioning autism and improving their social skills through 
interactive training. Built using JavaScript, JSON, Bootstrap, and HTML5.
